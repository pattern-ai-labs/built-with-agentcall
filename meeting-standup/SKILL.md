# Standup Manager — a skill that runs your team's standup, then manages the summary

> **This file is the rulebook for how you behave in the meeting. Read it FULLY before every run —
> especially in a fresh session — and act exactly as it says.** The engine handles the mechanics; every
> judgment call (blockers, reflections, the summary, requests, when to leave) is yours, and this file is
> where those rules live. Don't improvise a different protocol mid-call.

**For managers and team leads.** This turns your AI agent into the person who *runs* standup. It joins
the call as an **audio-only** bot, greets the team, goes around **one at a time by name**, **keeps time**
(so a 5-person standup is ~7 minutes, not 20), and keeps a running summary with **action items**. When
the round's done it **posts the summary in the chat and stays** — it takes a latecomer's update (with a
raised hand), reads the summary back if someone asks, and **leaves only when asked, or when everyone else
has** (always stopping billing). It also **remembers blockers across days** and follows up on them.

## You are the brain — but stay OUT of the round's way (this is the important part)

**The bot runs the round itself, fast and deterministically** — it auto-starts the moment anyone speaks,
times each turn, drops a quick filler ("Got it, thanks") between people, and never waits on you. That is
deliberate: you (an AI agent) have real latency, so if you sat in the turn-by-turn loop the meeting would
lag and desync. **So don't drive the round. Do your thinking asynchronously and in standby.**

Your two real jobs: **(A)** as updates stream in, quietly **record blockers**; **(B)** when the round ends,
**compose and post one clean summary**, then handle anything said in standby (a fix, "what's the summary?",
"you can leave"). Everything is a tiny file link: the bot appends to `link/heard.jsonl`; you append one
line to `link/commands.jsonl`. **Start watching the moment you launch:**
```bash
tail -n +1 -f link/heard.jsonl      # each new line is an event; append your reply to link/commands.jsonl
```
(POSIX; on Windows see the alternatives just below.) The bot runs what you append within ~0.12s.

**Windows alternatives:**
- **Git Bash** (ships with Git for Windows): all commands above work as-is.
- **WSL**: all commands above work as-is.
- **PowerShell:** replace `tail -f` with `Get-Content -Wait`:
  ```powershell
  Get-Content -Wait "$PWD\link\heard.jsonl"
  ```
- **Native cmd (no alternatives installed):** fall back to polling the file.

**Lines the bot sends you** (`link/heard.jsonl`) — each has an `id`, a `kind`, and context:

| `kind` | when | what you do |
|---|---|---|
| `update` | a person's turn ended | the bot gives a **quick generic ack itself** and moves on — you do **NOT** need to reflect every turn. Just **note their update for your running summary**, and if it implies a blocker send `{"cmd":"blocker","for":"<name>","text":"<blocker>"}`. (A one-line personalised reflection `{"cmd":"reflect","for":"<name>","text":"…"}` is a nice bonus ONLY if you can land it instantly; otherwise skip it — the generic ack has it covered.) **If `no_update` is true, the bot already says a short "no update from <name>" line — just note it.** |
| `round_done` | everyone's done; the bot has just said a short "let me pull the summary together" to cover the gap | **compose + post the summary YOURSELF, synthesised in your own words — NEVER the raw transcript read back.** Build each person's line as their `update` arrives, so by now it is ready to send instantly. In order: (1) `{"cmd":"chat","text":"…"}` the FULL clean summary + action items; (2) `{"cmd":"say","text":"…"}` a **spoken recap** — a brief line for each person (a little of what they are on, not just a headline) plus the blockers; keep each line tight so it still speaks quickly, with the full detail in the chat; (3) **if there are blockers**, ask the room **ONCE for ALL of them in a single question** (never one-per-blocker): `{"cmd":"say","text":"A couple of blockers came up: <b1>, and <b2>. Anyone got a workaround for either?","listen":true}`, then attach an answer with `solution` **only if it is a genuine, relevant fix** for that blocker — ignore banter/off-topic chatter, and if no real fix comes, leave the blocker open. Ask for fixes ONLY here — never mid-standup |
| `standby` | someone spoke while standing by | interpret: **"what's the summary?" → `{"cmd":"say","text":"<the FULL summary, spoken>"}`**; "you can head out" → `{"cmd":"leave"}`; a fix someone offers → `{"cmd":"solution","for":"<name>","text":"<fix>"}`; **a missed/muted person giving their standup now ("sorry, I was on mute — my update is …") → `{"cmd":"record","for":"<speaker>","text":"…"}` (+ `blocker` if implied), acknowledge with a short `say`, and re-post the refreshed summary to chat** — or `{"cmd":"ask","person":"<speaker>"}` to give them a proper spoken turn; else `{"cmd":"none"}` |
| `chat` | someone posted in the meeting **chat** (`sender` + `text`) | **be conservative — most chat is links, asides, or banter.** `{"cmd":"record","for":"<sender>","text":"…"}` only when it clearly reads as that person's OWN update (or they said they'd post it, e.g. bad mic). **If someone accounts for a quiet teammate** ("Arjun didn't do anything"): don't record it as the sender's; HOLD it, and only if that teammate ends with **no update of their own**, record it for THEM, sourced — `{"cmd":"record","for":"<teammate>","text":"(per <sender>) …"}`. Their own update always wins: if they later give one, record theirs with `"replace":true`. A fix → `solution`. Else → `{"cmd":"none"}` |
| `addendum` | the *previous* person kept talking after their turn closed (a long thinking pause) | already folded into their update for you — no reply needed; just update your notes (and send a `blocker` if the new bit implies one) |
| `silent` | someone was asked but no speech has come through yet | usually just wait (`{"cmd":"none"}`). If they're clearly away → `{"cmd":"skip"}`; a gentle nudge is fine but optional |
| `joined` | a fresh participant joined (fires once per person) | to take a latecomer's standup: `{"cmd":"say","text":"Welcome <name>…"}` then `{"cmd":"ask","person":"<name>"}`. Otherwise nothing |
| `summary_updated` | a latecomer's update was folded in | re-post the refreshed summary with `{"cmd":"chat","text":"…"}` |
| `followup` | a cross-day follow-up answer (their `prior` blockers are listed) | judge it: `{"cmd":"resolve","for":"<name>","cleared":true｜false}` |
| `addressed` | someone said the bot's **name** during a turn | interpret and reply: "skip me" → `skip`; a question → `say`; **"I was on mute earlier — here's my standup: …" → `{"cmd":"record","for":"<speaker>","text":"…"}`, or `{"cmd":"ask","person":"<speaker>"}` for a proper turn (mid-round this queues them politely after the current speaker — it never interrupts)** |

**Commands you can send** (`link/commands.jsonl`, one JSON per line, echo the `id` when replying to one):

| command | effect |
|---|---|
| `{"cmd":"blocker","for":"<name>","text":"<blocker>"}` | record a blocker you spotted in an update (async — doesn't interrupt anything) |
| `{"cmd":"record","for":"<name>","text":"…"}` | store a person's update text (e.g. one they posted in the chat) so it lands in the summary + file |
| `{"cmd":"reflect","for":"<name>","text":"…"}` | say a one-line reflection of their update and advance to the next person |
| `{"cmd":"chat","text":"…"}` | post your composed summary + action items into the meeting chat |
| `{"cmd":"say","text":"…","listen":true}` | speak (read the summary, greet a latecomer, ask the room about a blocker). `"listen":true` keeps forwarding standby speech so you catch the reply |
| `{"cmd":"solution","for":"<name>","text":"<fix>"}` | attach a fix to that person's blocker (turns it into the action item) |
| `{"cmd":"ask","person":"Sam"}` | take a specific person's standup (e.g. a latecomer) |
| `{"cmd":"resolve","for":"<name>","cleared":true｜false}` | close (or keep) a cross-day blocker after a follow-up |
| `{"cmd":"leave"}` | leave the meeting — billing stops. Use when asked to head out |
| `{"cmd":"skip"}` / `{"cmd":"next"}` | override the timing: skip the current person, or wrap them early. Rarely needed |
| `{"cmd":"say","text":"…"}` / `{"cmd":"none"}` | speak / do nothing |

**Rhythm:** the bot acks each turn generically itself, so **don't reflect every turn** — just record any blocker and note the update for the summary. **As each update lands, fold that person into your running
summary** (a synthesised line in your own words, never their raw transcript), built in parallel across the
round so it never blocks anything and is already assembled by the end. When
everyone's done (`round_done`): **`chat` the full summary, `say` a spoken summary** of each person + the
blockers, then **ask the room for workarounds** to those blockers and attach what comes back. In standby,
answer any question, catch late fixes, and **leave when asked**. **Never block the round** beyond the
reflection — everything else is async or in standby. **Never ask for a fix mid-round** — only after everyone.

**Two rules for the summary:**
1. **Reflect per person; full summary at the end.** After each person, mirror their update in a line ("so
   you did X, blocked on Y — got it"). At the end, *speak* a real summary (everyone + blockers) AND put the
   full thing in chat. If someone later asks "what's the summary?", read the full one aloud again.
2. **Attribute honestly — keep YOUR ideas separate from what people said.** A workaround a person stated is
   *their* plan. A fix *you're* proposing is a **suggestion** — label it (a separate "Suggestion (from
   <bot>):" line). Never fold your own idea into a person's update or action item as though they said it.

## Do this in order

**0 · Preflight (once).** API key — check `~/.agentcall/config.json` → `AGENTCALL_API_KEY` env; if neither,
ask the user and write it to `~/.agentcall/config.json`. Then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**1 · Set the roster.** In `config.jsonc`, fill `TEAM` with the people to call on, **in order**, using the
name each shows as in the meeting. If the user didn't give you one, ask once. (Absent roster members are
skipped and noted; anyone present who isn't on the roster still gets a turn.)

**2 · (optional) Dry-run:** `python scripts/standup.py --local` — a scripted run (round → standby →
latecomer → leave) with no meeting or billing.

**3 · Launch, and immediately start watching the link:**
```bash
python scripts/standup.py "https://meet.google.com/abc-def-ghi" &
tail -n +1 -f link/heard.jsonl
```
It appears in ~30–90s, greets, and waits for a go-ahead — which comes to you as a `waiting` line. Pass
`--auto` to skip waiting. `--name` / `--voice` override the config.

**4 · Drive it.** Reply `start` on the go-ahead; let the round run (it times itself); when `round_done`
arrives, post your polished summary + action items to chat; answer name-addressed questions; `leave` when
asked. Keep watching until the bot has left.

**5 · Finish.** It leaves on your `leave`, when everyone else leaves, or on Ctrl+C — **always stopping
billing** (it sends the leave command and DELETEs the call, with retries, on every exit path).

## What's deterministic vs. yours

- **Deterministic (the bot, no keywords):** join, greet, the round-robin *timing* (a nudge near
  `PER_PERSON_SECONDS`, then it moves on; a turn ends on `SILENCE_ENDS_TURN` of quiet), capturing each
  update, the fix-beat *plumbing* (ask → listen → attach → park), a heuristic summary + action items to
  disk and chat, raising a hand for a latecomer, the cross-day follow-up, leaving on an empty room, and
  billing-safe teardown.
- **Yours (the brain):** judging what's a blocker, what to ask, and what's a real fix; starting on a
  go-ahead; sharp action items and the polished chat summary; answering questions; leaving on request.
  All interpreted by you — never by brittle keyword lists.

**Token cost is bounded to decisions, not talk.** Mid-turn speech is captured locally (free); the bot only
forwards to you at decision points — one `update` per turn, the fix beat's few utterances, name-addressed
lines, and lifecycle events. Idle chatter is dropped. So a 5-person standup is ~a dozen round-trips, not
one per sentence.

## Config (`config.jsonc`)

`TEAM` (names + order) · `QUESTIONS` (asked as one prompt) · `PER_PERSON_SECONDS` / `NUDGE_AT_SECONDS` /
`SILENCE_ENDS_TURN` / `NO_RESPONSE_SECONDS` (the timeboxing feel) · `WAIT_FOR_GO_AHEAD` ·
`TRACK_ACROSS_DAYS` (the cross-day blocker memory) · `POST_SUMMARY_TO_CHAT` · `OUTPUT_DIR`/`OUTPUT_FORMAT`.
Key/name/voice come from `~/.agentcall/config.json` (the shared AgentCall config; bot name falls back to
`Scrum` — pick a short, STT-friendly name, long ones get misheard).

## How it works

`standup.py` spawns AgentCall's **audio bridge** (`engine/bridge.py`, `mode: audio`) and drives it over
stdin/stdout: it **speaks** via `tts.speak`, **hears** each person as a VAD-coalesced `user.message`
(speaker + text), **posts chat** via `send_chat`, and **raises a hand** via `raise_hand`. A single-threaded
event loop runs the round; per-turn-token timers handle the nudge / timebox / silence / no-response so a
stale timer can never fire into the next turn. What it hears goes to `link/heard.jsonl`; your
`link/commands.jsonl` replies are applied within ~0.12s. Capture, blocker heuristics, cross-day
reconciliation, action items, and the summary are all local — no model, no network beyond the meeting.

Run from the skill root (`meeting-standup/`) so `config.jsonc`, `link/`, and `standups/` resolve; the
script finds `engine/` on its own, and the key/name come from `~/.agentcall/config.json`.

## Checking for updates (optional)

Optional — the skill is backwards-compatible and runs fine without ever checking. To see whether there's
a newer version, look at the source repo `github.com/pattern-ai-labs/built-with-agentcall` (folder
`meeting-standup`) and compare it with your copy. How to update depends on how it was installed:

- **An agent cloned the repo** → `git pull` in that repo (or just re-fetch the `meeting-standup` folder).
- **Installed via `npx skills add`** → re-run the same command to pull the latest:
  `npx skills add pattern-ai-labs/built-with-agentcall --skill meeting-standup`

Nothing to configure and no version check to run — updating only swaps in newer files.
