/**
 * AgentCall Audio Player — Drop-in audio queue for webpage modes.
 *
 * In webpage modes (webpage-audio, webpage-av, webpage-av-screenshare),
 * audio from GetSun (collaborative voice intelligence) or AgentCall TTS arrives as base64-encoded 24kHz PCM
 * chunks via WebSocket events. This player:
 *
 * 1. Decodes base64 PCM → AudioBuffer
 * 2. Queues chunks for gapless sequential playback
 * 3. On `tts.audio_clear` → stops playback + flushes queue immediately
 * 4. On `transcript.partial` during playback → debounced interruption
 *    (see below). When confirmed, clears audio and fires onInterrupted
 *    with the played and not_played sentence lists.
 *
 * INTERRUPTION DETECTION (direct mode, webpage modes 2-4):
 * FirstCall does NOT transcribe bot audio — transcript.partial always
 * comes from a human participant. But a single partial isn't a
 * reliable interruption signal: STT also fires partials for short
 * fillers ("mhm", "uh"), background noise, mic bumps, and brief
 * acknowledgments that aren't meant to interrupt. A naive "first
 * partial → cut audio" rule cuts the bot off constantly in noisy
 * group meetings.
 *
 * Debounce: on the FIRST partial during playback, the player suspends
 * the AudioContext (pauses the bot's audio output mid-stream — context
 * currentTime stops advancing), starts a 2-second window, and fires
 * onSuspensionStart so the template can flip the avatar to "interrupted"
 * for immediate visual feedback. Partials are incremental (each carries
 * only the new words spoken since the previous partial), so we sum word
 * counts across partials inside the window. Once the total reaches
 * wordThreshold (2) the interrupt is confirmed: audio is cleared and
 * onInterrupted fires. If the window expires below threshold, ctx is
 * resumed and onSuspensionEnd fires so the template can revert to
 * "speaking" — the brief silence is the only visible side effect of a
 * false alarm.
 *
 * CHUNK GATE AFTER CONFIRMATION:
 * Once the interrupt is confirmed, the backend doesn't know yet — its
 * TTS pipeline keeps streaming in-flight chunks for the original
 * utterance for hundreds of ms. Without a gate, those chunks would
 * refill the queue and the bot would resume talking right after we
 * cleared. So _handleInterruption sets this.interrupted = true, which
 * makes playChunk silently drop incoming chunks until the next
 * tts.started event (signaling the agent's new utterance is starting).
 *
 * Collaborative-mode interruption (tts.audio_clear from GetSun) bypasses
 * the debounce — that signal comes from a sophisticated voice
 * intelligence service and is treated as authoritative. It does NOT
 * set the chunk gate because GetSun continues streaming new utterances
 * without an explicit tts.started boundary.
 *
 * SENTENCE TRACKING:
 * Each tts.webpage_audio event can include sentence_index, sentence_text,
 * and duration_ms. On confirmed interruption the player categorizes
 * every queued sentence as either played (fully heard by participants)
 * or not_played (cut mid-way OR queued but never started). The
 * mid-cut sentence goes in not_played because the message wasn't
 * fully delivered.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   const player = new AgentCallAudio({
 *     onStateChange: (playing) => setState(playing ? "speaking" : "listening"),
 *     onSuspensionStart: () => setState("interrupted"),
 *     onSuspensionEnd:   () => setState("speaking"),
 *     onInterrupted: (info) => {
 *       setState("interrupted");
 *       ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'tts.interrupted', ...info }));
 *     }
 *   });
 *   ws.onmessage = (e) => player.handleEvent(JSON.parse(e.data));
